# MyReads Project

This is simple React-based app for managing reading list. It consists of the main screen where user books are displayed and the search screen allowing to search for new books at server. </br>
The main screen is divided into 3 bookshelves. The user is allowed to move books between shelves with special control. Book can be removed from main screen by selecting "None" shelf. </br>
Search screen has a search text box. Search is performed after user finishes typing search request (1 second after search field has changed for last time). The user can add any book from this screen to his collection by just choosing the shelf in special control. </br>
User actions such as changing a shelf for a book or adding new book to the collection are saved on a server.
